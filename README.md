# 📊 Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate – Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository! 🚀
This is where I document and showcase all the projects I complete as part of the **[Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics)** on Coursera.

The projects in this repo highlight my journey of learning, applying, and mastering advanced data analytics concepts — from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and storytelling with data.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each course/project will have its own dedicated folder with:

* **Project Report / Notebook** – analysis, code, and findings
* **Datasets (if allowed to share)** or links to dataset sources
* **README** inside the folder with course-specific/project-specific details

``will update the repository file structure when course is completed``
