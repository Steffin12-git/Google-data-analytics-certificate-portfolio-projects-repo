# 📊 Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate – Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository! 🚀
This is where I document and showcase all the projects I complete as part of the **[Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics)** on Coursera.

The projects in this repo highlight my journey of learning, applying, and mastering advanced data analytics concepts — from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and storytelling with data.
